# Optimizing-Air-Travel-Through-Flight-Delay-Prediction
Analyzed 1M+ flights, finding carrier &amp; late aircraft as key controllable delay drivers. Built ML models (LogReg, SVM, RF) with 88% CV accuracy, AUC 0.90, F1 0.80; regression R=1.0, MAE=86 min. Used SHAP &amp; OAI for crew scheduling, turnaround audits &amp; flight retiming, cutting operational delays.
